This file documents the AI prompts used during development, as required by Cloudflare.

## Setup phase

### Idea and choices evaluation

Prompt: requested extensive documentation about the CloudFlare's technologies cited in the project request

Goal: I wanted to be sure of choosing and adopting project-optimal tools.

Prompt: requested a deep judgment for the features and the tech stack I've personally produced and proposed (as found in the first hand-written README).

Outcome: the whole idea and choices came up as perfectly solid; no changes were needed.
